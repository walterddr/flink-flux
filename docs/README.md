# Uber Flink-Services Documentation

This directory contains all documentation hosted by [readthedocs][doc].

## Building

The documentation is built with [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/).
You need to have [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) installed.

Then simply run `mkdocs` command to build the docs page.

## Deploying

Raise a PR on GitHub. Once the PR is approved and merged,
ask one of the maintainers to kick off the build on [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/uber-flink-services/).
